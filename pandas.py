'''Select the cars_per_cap column from cars as a Pandas Series and store it as cpc.
Use cpc in combination with a comparison operator and 500. You want to end up with a boolean Series that's True if the corresponding country has a cars_per_cap of more than 500 and False otherwise. Store this boolean Series as many_cars.
Use many_cars to subset cars, similar to what you did before. Store the result as car_maniac.
Print out car_maniac to see if you got it right.'''
